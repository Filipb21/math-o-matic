Instructions:

- Click the play button to start the game.
- Once you've done that, there is a timer bar at the top of the page that will shrink to the left side; once the bar has completely disappeared, you are out of time and the game is over. 
- The game is also over if you select the incorrect answer to a question, such as the sum of two numbers is equal the bottom number shown when it is not, or that the sum shown is incorrect when it actually is. Everytime you make the correct decision in the short time frame available, you will receive another point to your score, which can be tracked at the top right of the screen while playing. The goal is to reach the highest number of points and to continue beating your highscore.
- Once the game is over, you will then be able to view your current score for that game as well the highscore, and the option to restart the game in the form of an replay icon.
